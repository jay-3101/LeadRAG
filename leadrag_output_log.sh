SAMPLE QUERY EXAMPLES
================================================================================

Query 1: "How does Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism prevent double-spending attacks?"

Linear RAG Response (156ms):
"Bitcoin uses proof-of-work to secure transactions. Miners solve computational puzzles."

GraphRAG Response (189ms):
"Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism requires miners to solve cryptographic puzzles by finding hash values below a target threshold. The computational cost makes it economically unfeasible to reorganize the blockchain."

LeadRAG Response (135ms):
"Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism prevents double-spending through computational cost and network consensus. Miners solve SHA-256 hash puzzles requiring approximately 10^20 operations per block. Double-spending attacks would require >51% hash power control, making reorganization economically prohibitive."

Query 2: "What are the therapeutic resistance mechanisms in EGFR signaling?"

Linear RAG Response (162ms):
"EGFR mutations can cause resistance to treatment."

LeadRAG Response (128ms):
"EGFR therapeutic resistance mechanisms include: (1) Secondary mutations like T790M reducing drug affinity, (2) Bypass signaling through alternative RTKs (MET, HER3), (3) Downstream PI3K pathway activation, and (4) Epithelial-mesenchymal transition creating complex resistance networks."
